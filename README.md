hello! this is my indev project of an idle game made on html, it is my first html + js + css project
this project has at least 3 minutes of gameplay as of now, because the balancing
was made in a single day, and that really sucks! well, it is in development
so i hope it gets better

# the graphics
i know, i know. my css  is painfully ugly, i havent even changed the font, but its my first project
*please* have mercy on me
